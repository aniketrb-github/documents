Ideally, which provides a good technical exposure, has good work environment with colleagues embracing & appreciating ideas, suggestions & opinions & correcting one & working together towards a consolidated goal. A job which helps u grow, not only technical aspects but also in d aspects of ur personal life. Not to mention, Free Food or at low cost would do, Free Transport or at low cost, Events, Music, Sports which helps us motivated & allows one to keep looking at something out of the office box. Gym is expected since being in IT field, I do try my best to get out of my cosy warm seat & spend time at the gym ensuring & enjoying more time in field than on bed/hospital. Open office concept would be surprising & amazing. Work from home when an employee needs time to be spent at home for genuine or obvious inevitable reasons would be appreciable. Not to forget the training as the technical re-enforcement upgrade we require as we all experience the growth rate & speed with which the IT world is progressing. Yes, its difficult and gets bit hard to switch or learn new technologies while working, but that's what the organisation has to look up to where it inculcates teaching-learning process with more fun. There should be events like sports, traditional, hackathons, challenges, tours regularly or anything which keeps us active, in the rhythm. Hah, It does feel of too much of asking here, but it is also a field where I can express my ideal things. Also, Client interaction which has more to do with transparency & work credit. Onsite opportunities not only for Tech leads, managers & senior s but also for junior & mid level employees. I would appreciate No work-time restrictions, punching in-out office time. Last but not the least fair/decent salary hike system which is based on the employee's work, talent, skill & the efforts one puts in ones tenure. I would like to work in a politics free environment which is why I'm writing this in a dream job section. An org. that cares.
